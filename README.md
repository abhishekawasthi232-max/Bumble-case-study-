# Bumble-case-study-
A deep-dive product case study reimagining Bumble’s chat-to-meet experience. In this project, I analyze Bumble’s drop-offs and design AI-powered solutions to fix them. A blend of research, strategy, and design thinking aimed at driving real connection.
🧠 Overview

NL Meet is an independent product strategy and research project aimed at improving Bumble’s chat-to-meet conversion funnel. The project explores behavioral barriers preventing online matches from turning into real-life meetups and proposes data-backed, design-led solutions that enhance engagement, trust, and monetization.

This project integrates product management, user research, and data analysis to design AI-driven, user-centric solutions for modern dating apps.

🎯 Problem Statement

Despite high match rates, Bumble experiences significant drop-offs between initial messages and meet-ups.
Research revealed that:

Male users often struggle with sustaining conversations or timing the meet-up suggestion.

Female users hesitate due to safety and trust concerns.

This leads to declining engagement, lower conversion to premium plans, and overall revenue impact.

🔍 Research & Insights
1. Market Research

2. User Research

Conducted surveys and secondary research on dating app users aged 22–27.

Key findings:

76% of men struggle with “what to say next.”

87% of women prioritize safety and authentic profiles.

Both genders prefer meeting after 3–5 days of chatting.

3. Business Impact

Bumble’s quarterly revenue dropped 7.6% YoY, with 11% decline in paying users (Nasdaq, 2025).

User churn due to low chat-to-meet conversions increases acquisition costs.
